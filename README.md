This repository was buld to help you getting **[NCIPLOT 4]([juliacontrerasgarcia/nciplot: Program for revealing non-covalent interactions (github.com)](https://github.com/juliacontrerasgarcia/nciplot))** running on your Windows computer as a requirement for Professor Julia Contreras-García's mini-course. For that we'll use Cygwin.

1. Right-click `setup-x86_64.exe` above and select "Save link as" to download Cygwin for Windows 64 bit.
  
2. Click [HERE ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HenriqueCSJ/CompChem2021/main/packagelist.txt)and then right-click anywhere on the screen to select "Save as".
  
3. Right-click `install_nciplot.sh` above to download the install script and select "Save link as" to download

Make sure that `setup-x86_64.exe` and `packagelist` are in the same folder! Now go to that folder
