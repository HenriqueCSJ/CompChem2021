This repository was buld to help you getting **[NCIPLOT 4]([juliacontrerasgarcia/nciplot: Program for revealing non-covalent interactions (github.com)](https://github.com/juliacontrerasgarcia/nciplot))** running on your Windows computer as a requirement for Professor Julia Contreras-García's mini-course. For that we'll use Cygwin.
